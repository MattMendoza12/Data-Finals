*   **Sort Inventory**: The inventory can be sorted by book title using a Bubble Sort algorithm that helps the user for browsing.
*   **Search for Books**: A Linear Search feature lets users look up a book by its title to check if the book is in the inventory.
*   **Order Processing**: A Queue structure handles customer book orders in a first-come, first-served manner.
